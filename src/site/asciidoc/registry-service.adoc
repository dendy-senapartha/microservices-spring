The main function of the service is to provides registration of running services and auto-discover
services needed by other services. Example, when Product Service and Order Service are starting up,
it will register them self to this service, when Order Service need to contact Product Service, the
Registry Service will provides the ip address or hostname of Product Service.

The service utilised https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/1.4.x/multi/multi_spring-cloud-eureka-server.html[Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Server].

== Configuration
The configuration for this service is provided by Configuration Service. It will load configuration
with the application name `registry`.

.src/main/resources/config/registry.yml
[source, yaml]
----
# EUREKA DISCOVERY
eureka:
  client:
    healthcheck:
      enabled: true
    registerWithEureka: false # no need to register
    fetchRegistry: false # no need to discover other services
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:9091/eureka
  instance:
    instanceId: ${spring.application.name}:${spring.application.instance_id:${random.value}}
    leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds: 5   # DO NOT DO THIS IN PRODUCTION
# TOMCAT
server:
  port: 9091
# ACTUATOR ENDPOINTS
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include:
          - health
          - info
          - env

One thing to note here is that we need to tell the service to load configuration from Configuration Service
by providing bootstrap file.
{bl}

.src/main/resources/bootstrap.yml
[source, yaml]
----
spring:
  application:
    name: registry
  cloud:
    config:
      uri:
        - http://localhost:9090
      fail-fast: true
      retry:
        initialInterval: 5000
        maxInterval: 5000
        maxAttempts: 10
----
{bl}

The service also uses https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry] to make sure that
when the Configuration Service is not available yet, it will retry to load the configuration several
times based on the given configuration.

== Testing
To test the service, build and run the project as described in link:project-layout.html[Project Layout]
then open the browser and access the following url format `[hostname]:[port]/[service-name]/[profile]`:

* `[hostname]` is the server name or ip address e.g. localhost, 127.0.0.1
* `[port]` is the server port e.g. 9091
* `[service-name]` is the _configuration name_.
* `[profile]` is the _profile name_.

By default the service will run using port number 9091. To access the Eureka dashboard go to the
following url http://localhost:9091/. All services registered on this Registry Services will be displayed.
